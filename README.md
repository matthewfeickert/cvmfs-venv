# cvmfs-venv

Example implementation of getting a Python virtual environment to work with CVMFS [LCG views][LCG_info]. This is done by adding additional hooks to the Python virtual environment's `bin/activate` script.

## Install

Either clone the repo to your directory or simply download the relevant files

```console
$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewfeickert/cvmfs-venv/main/atlas_setup.sh
```

## Use

Source the script to create a Python 3 virtual environment that can coexist with a CVMFS LCG view. The default name is `venv`.

```console
$ . atlas_setup.sh <name of your virtual environment>  # default name is 'venv'
```

### Example

```console
$ ssh lxplus
[feickert@lxplus732 ~]$ curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/matthewfeickert/cvmfs-venv/main/atlas_setup.sh
[feickert@lxplus732 ~]$ . atlas_setup.sh example

## Why is this needed?

When an LCG view or an ATLAS computing environment that uses software from CVFMS is setup it manipulates and alters the [`PYTHONPATH` environment variable][PYTHONPATH docs].
By placing the contents of all the installed software of an LCG view or ATLAS release onto `PYTHONPATH` for the rest of the shell session, the protections and isolation of a Python virtual environment are broken.
It is not possible to fix this in a reliable and robust way that will not break the access of other software in the LCG view or ATLAS environment dependent on the Python packages in them.
The best that can be done is to control the environment at the **head** of `PYTHONPATH` in a stable manner, that allows for most of the benefits of a Python virtual environment (control of install and versions of packages, isolation of directory tree).

## How things work

`cvmfs-venv` provides a shim layer to manage activation and use of a Python virtual environment created with LCG view resources.
It does this by copying the structure of the `activate` scripts generated by Python's [`venv` module][venv docs].
When `venv` creates a virtual environment it generates a shell script under the virtual environment's directory tree at `bin/activate`.
This `activate` script controls and edits the shell environmental variables `PATH` and [`PYTHONHOME`][PYTHONHOME docs] &mdash; placing the virtual environment's `bin/` directory onto `PATH` and unsetting `PYTHONHOME` upon activation, and restoring their original values when `deactivate` is run.
`cvmfs-venv` simply extends this existing behavior to also place the virtual environment's `lib/` directory onto `PYTHONPATH` during activation and to remove it on deactivation.
This is done by injecting Bash snippets directly into the `bin/activate` script generated by `venv` at positions found relative to the manipulation of `PYTHONHOME`.
